Model description       : "2076 A.D. Everything that you believe to be true is a condradiction.
			  Imagine a world that is suffering a slow decay, and a culture on the edge
			  extinction.  A world of chaos brought to obedient order by the machines man
			  created.
				In this time, man has becomea docile creature herded to submission under
			  the mechanical laws that apply, programmed and desensitized for their convenience."

			  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			  REPORTER:
				"We now have word that EDGECRUSHER has eluded the enforcers, and has fled the
				area.  Much damage has been sustained by the facility, and quite a few civilian
				and state casualties have been accounted for"

				"The state has allocated reinforcementsfor the tracking, apprehension, and
				custody of EDGECRUSHER.  We have been informed that a SMASHER/DEVOURER module has
				been issued for reconnaissance."

			  ON THE MONITOR APPEARS ON IMAGE THAT LOOKS SOLID AND MECHANICAL.  A BI-PEDAL DESIGN
			  WITH AN EGG-SHAPED, ARMOURED MAINFRAME.  WHAT APPEARS TO BE ARMS ARE ACTUALLY WEAPONRY
			  FOR PROTECTION.  THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THIS MACHINE AS IT LUMBERS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE OF
			  THE FACILITY.

			  REPORTER:
				"Now that SMASHER/DEVOURER is on the scene, we will hopefully see an end to the
				violence, and our city will sleep in safe comfort tonight."

			  Taken from the inlay of the Fear Factory albulm: Obsolete, which the track SMASHER/DEVOUER
			  inspired this model. The names of the two deathmatch skins, Replica and Scumgrief, are named
			  after tracks on their Demanufacture and Soul of a New Machine albulms.  I recomend checking them,
			  as their music is perfect for deathmatches, and the lyrics are a bit smarter than what you get normally
			  with this sort of music.


Other info              : My second player model. It has legs! I think you can see me getting better in the skins and weapon models as I went along...

			  on this thing till midnight after weekday work.

YF-19 ...by sTuPiD fOoL

This is my first attempt at a Quake2 Plugin Player Model.  It's the YF-19 from Macross Plus (an excellent flik, if you can find it in the anime section - SUBBED NOT DUBBED).  Understand that i was in a rush at the end, so the model skin and weapon skin are sucky, and TEMPORARY!  PLEASE someone do some better skins!  ...like that guy who did the original battroid model..those skins were SUPERB... 

Thanks go out to Brian "EvilBastard" Collins, who patiently answered my endless questions, and did me so many favors.  I'd also like to thank Kon, who helped me test the skin, and Rikki "Phukyumoto" Knight for finally getting rid of the null skin errors!

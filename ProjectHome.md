## One Story ##

In a distant future, with space travel and such, there is no need for
heros anymore. Saving the world doesn't matter that much, when there
are so many worlds to save.

But when the only thing you learned is melting stuff with your trusty plasgun
and when you dream at night, you dream of shiny new equipment. Then there's still a place for you in this world. Team up and sign in - you're a space mercenary - send by the administration to save this world, or maybe only their resources?

Fight alien scum, human scum and robot scum in the outskirts of the universe,
on a planet of utter unimportance. Maybe save this world, and for once be a hero.
Maybe it's time start over with this life, this world and try a step in a different
direction.

It's time for the first iteration. It's time for iteration zero.

Well at least you'll be able to bath the other scum in soring plasma fire.
That's something.

This model is my second Plug in Player model and was
actually going to be an ostrich with a guy riding him
but i sort of got side tracked halfway thru.

the right arm will look like its missing in the player setup screen 
this is because his right arm is actually the weapon.md2 
dont worry everything looks groovey in the game.

the skin is just a mix of textures from other skins
which i think work pretty well.

someone who does cool skins feel free to make a better one.

###setup###

Unzip this stuff into quake2/baseq2/players/sligg, otherwise, it doesn't work.
you should have the following placed in said dir:

tris.md2        sligg model
weapon.md2      his gun model/also his right arm
sligg_i.pcx       the multiplayer select icon
sligg.pcx         skin
weapon.pcx      gun skin
sligg.txt      this file


###Extras###

none

###Bugs###

none that i know of

###Disclaimer###

Do what you wish with this model as long as its not for
commercial purposes and you give me a credit.

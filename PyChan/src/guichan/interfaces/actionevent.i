    /**
     * Represents an action event. An action event is an event
     * that can be fired by a widget whenever an action has occured.
     * What exactly an action is is up to the widget that fires
     * the action event. An example is a Button which fires an action
     * event as soon as the Button is clicked, another example is
     * TextField which fires an action event as soon as the enter
     * key is pressed.
     *
     * Any object can listen for actions from widgets by implementing
     * the ActionListener interface.
     *
     * If you have implement a widget of your own it's a good idea to 
     * let the widget fire action events whenever you feel an action
     * has occured so action listeners of the widget can be informed
     * of the state of the widget.

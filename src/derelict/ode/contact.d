/**
 * @brief Describe the contact point between two geoms.
 *
 * If two bodies touch, or if a body touches a static feature in its
 * environment, the contact is represented by one or more "contact
 * points", described by dContactGeom.
 *
 * The convention is that if body 1 is moved along the normal vector by
 * a distance depth (or equivalently if body 2 is moved the same distance
 * in the opposite direction) then the contact depth will be reduced to
 * zero. This means that the normal vector points "in" to body 1.
 *
